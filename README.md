### Instructions:

The user should download processing and open the .pde file.
Once a user runs the program, they have to choose a image to encode. Once they chose that image then they can drag the mouse to draw on the canvas. The text on the bottom right tells you what encoding mode you are in and presing enter encodes what you drew into the image you chose.
