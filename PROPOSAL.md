# Final Project Proposal

## Group Members:

Victoria Shi
       
# Intentions:

Create a image stegonography tool to create hidden messages that will be viewable in StegSolve.
    
# Intended usage:

Users will run the program in processing and be able to draw to change the LSB's of a image. 
  
# Technical Details:

This project is a tool used for image stenography and involves the concept of least signifigant bits of pixel values in a image. Since this is a solo project I will be doing all parts of it.
  
    
# Intended pacing:

5-20: Finish basics and make sure that drawing actually changes the pixel values
5-30: Create seperate canvas where anything drawn on it only partially reflects on resulting image
6-4: Finish different encoding modes
