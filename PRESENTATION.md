# LSB Stenography in Processing

### Project Description
The goal of this project was too create a program that could hide messages in the least signigigant bits of pixel values in images.
Unlike the image stenography lab we did for class before, this program can create messages visbile to the naked eye when viewing through StegSolve and is much more interactive.

### How it works
- First the user must draw their message
- Then the original image gets compared to the mask and the corresponding pixel changes based on the type of encoding
- The encoded image then gets saved as a png and can be run through StegSolve to see the results

### Types of Encoding
- Red Plane 0
- Green Plane 0
- Blue Plane 0

### Demonstration
